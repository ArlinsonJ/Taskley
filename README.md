# Taskley
Taskley is a robust desktop application designed to help users manage their tasks effectively. Its 
core features include: 
●  Task Management:  Create, edit, delete, and filter  tasks using a local SQLite database. 
●  Due Date and Timer Support:  Real-time countdown timers  and reminders with 
customizable MP3 ringtones. 
●  User Customization:  Options such as dark mode, military  time formatting, and an 
"always on top" feature, with settings persisted using QSettings. 
●  Intuitive User Interface:  A multi-screen design managed  via PySide6’s 
QStackedWidget, which includes an attractive custom squircle-shaped minimized 
window and interactive details on each task. 
These functionalities are realized through a well-structured Python implementation using 
PySide6 and pygame for audio feedback.
